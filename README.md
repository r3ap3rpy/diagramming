### Welcome

This repository holds source materials for my [diagrams]() video series..

You can find the official documentation [here](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/getting-started/installation).

In order to get started you need to install the prerequisites.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/r3ap3rpy/diagramming.git
cd diagramming
virtualenv d
.\d\scripts\activate
pip install diagrams
```

You also need to install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download) as it is one of the dependencies.
